Time Complexity:
The TC = O(N) as each node is visited exactly once.
SC= O(H)(Recursive Stack Auxiliary Space) where H is the height of the binary tree.
The recursion stack space is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion, which is the height of the binary tree denoted as H. 
In worst case the height = O(N) and in balanced BT =O(log2N)
